# beertracker
Android application to reward healthy habits with beer

## Use case for this application
- Have a way to track "points" (beers in our case) using the app as well as an onscreen widget
- This will have two buttons - one to increment and one to decrement
- There will be flexibility in the app to allow for the following:
1. A "standard" number of beers per time period
1. A time period for the beer standard to reset (removing bonus beers)
1. An option for the bonus beers to stay and not reset with the standard number
